                        I started my journey at <strong>Tafila Technical University</strong>, earning a <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems</strong> (Jan 2020 - May 2023). After that, I joined the <strong>Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair School of Advanced Computing (ASAC)</strong> as a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer JavaScript Intern</strong> (Apr 2023 - Oct 2023), where I deepened my expertise in modern web technologies.
